Biomass Based Thermal Energy Generation By Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited, at FTO-07, Duvvada, Visakhapatnam, AP

The project Biomass Based Thermal Energy Generation is located at FTO-07, VSEZ, in Village
Duuvvada, Tehsil Duvvada, District Visakhapatnam, State Andhra Pradesh, Country INDIA.

Purpose of the project activity:
Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (DRL), a leading multinational pharmaceutical company based in India
and overseas, committed to providing affordable and innovative medicines.
Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories started in 1984 with a modest investment and a bold vision. Today, with
research and development centres, manufacturing facilities and commercial presence across the
globe, we serve over half a billion patients worldwide. Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories aspire to triple our
reach and touch over 1.5 billion patients by 2030.

The UCR project activity consists of the generation of thermal energy by utilizing renewable
biomass process boilers of total installed capacity of 4.5 TPH at the Formulations Manufacturing
Facility (Formulation Tech-Ops)-07 (FTO-07), owned and operated by the Project Proponent (PP).
The project activity involves the installation of one (01) Biomass Briquette fired steam boilers with
a steam output capacity of 4.5 TPH (at F & A 1000C). This project activity uses renewable biomass
briquettes as fuel and supplies the process steam throughout the plant for an important process of
manufacturing, sterilization and clean steam generation for advanced procedures within the project
boundary at FTO-07 VSEZ, Duvvada, Visakhapatnam.
The boiler installed is a “horizontal Water and Smoke tube type boiler with dynamic step grate type
that ensure 100% firing of biomass briquettes/rice, through intelligent combustion manager.
Conventionally, steam required for the processes in FTO-07 was met through a 4 nos of furnace oil
fired boilers (1*3 TPH, 1*2 TPH and 2*4 TPH) which were operating inside the plant premises.
Fossil fuel (furnace oil) combustion in these boilers produces greenhouse gases (GHGs).
This project activity displaces/avoids the use of fossil fuel (furnace oil) with briquette (renewable
biomass) which is a clean and carbon neutral energy source. Also, the new boiler is more efficient
than the old furnace oil fired boilers. Thus, the project activity helps in reduction of GHG
emissions.

The primary technology for the project activity involves installation of 1*4.5 TPH biomass fired
boilers. The direct combustion of biomass in the boiler is converted into thermal energy, which is
utilized for steam generation. The boiler in the project activity was commissioned on 26.11.2021.
The briquettes, used in the boiler within the project activity, are composed of mainly agro-based
industrial residues and crop residues based on their availability from the surrounding region outside
the project boundary (the PP is not the producer of the processed solid biomass fuel as specified in
the requirements of the UCR CoU Standard for inclusion in the updated eligibility conditions
specified in the UCR biomass program).

The boiler offers progressive combustion with distinct combustion zones making it the ideal
solution for biomass briquette combustion with higher moisture. This grate offers the fuel flexibility
and can burn complex agricultural biomass fuels like forest wastes, empty fruit bunches, spice
waste, soya stock, and many other biomasses.
